SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my ePortfolio! I'm Alexa Szlykowicz, and I've had a lifelong passion for computers. From a young age, I found myself fascinated by how they work, from the intricate coding to the endless possibilities they offer. Whether it's programming, troubleshooting, or simply exploring the latest tech trends, I'm always eager to dive in and learn more. It's not just a hobby for me; it's a way of life. 

The primary objective is to demonstrate proficiency and expertise in SQL. I want to showcase to potential employers, clients, or collaborators that I have a strong command of SQL concepts, syntax, and best practices. My ePortfolio serves as a platform to highlight the SQL projects I've worked on and the achievements I've accomplished through learning SQL skills. By showcasing real-world examples of my work, I hope to provide tangible evidence of my abilities and accomplishments in SQL.

I will also be including a few projects displaying some capabilities with noSQL. I have experience with MongoDB, Mongoose, and Jupyter Notebook.
